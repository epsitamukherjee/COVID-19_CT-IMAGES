# COVID-19_CT-IMAGES
DEEP LEARNING-BASED CLASSIFICATION MODEL FOR COVID-19 DISEASE FROM CHEST CT IMAGES:-

We are using the dataset provided by : He, X., Yang, X., Zhang, S., Zhao, J., Zhang, Y., Xing, E., & Xie, P. (2020).

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that has caused about 386,000
deaths all over the world, among 6.5 million infected cases, as of June 3rd, 2020. One major
hurdle in controlling the spreading of this disease is the shortage of tests. The current tests
are mostly based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). During the
peak time of COVID-19 outbreak, RT-PCR test kits were in great shortage. As a result,
many suspected cases cannot be tested in time and they continue to spread the disease to
others unconsciously. To mitigate the shortage of RT-PCR test kits, hospitals have been
utilizing alternative diagnosis methods. Among them, computed tomography (CT) scans
have been used for screening and diagnosing COVID-19.

The dataset used in the study has been taken from-  https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT

The COVID-CT-Dataset has 349 CT images containing clinical findings of COVID-19 from 216 patients.
